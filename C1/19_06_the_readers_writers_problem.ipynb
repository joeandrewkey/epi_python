    "### 19_06 The readers-writers problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider an object *s* which is read from and written to by many threads.  (For example, *s* could be the cache from Problem 19.1 on Page 291.)  You need to ensure that no thread may access *s* for reading or writing while another thread is writing to s.  (Two or more readers may access s at the same time.)\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to achieve this is by protecting *s* with a mutex that ensures that two threads cannot access *s* at the same time.  However, this solution is suboptimal because it is possible that a reader *R1* has locked *s* and another reader *R2* wants to access *s*.  Reader *R2* does not have to wait until *R1* is done reading, *R2* should start reading right away.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This motivates the first readers-writers problem:  protect s with the added constraint that no reader is to be kept waiting if s is currently opened for reading.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement a synchronization mechanism for the first readers-writers problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint**: Track the number of readers\n",
    "\n",
    "### Remarks\n",
    "\n",
    "It seems like there should be a reader counter that increments for every reader that wishes to read.  This reader counter guards the data from writers, and must be zero before the writer can do its work.  You may wish to make it such that a queued up writer blocks new readers.  I also think that since writers are important and we do not want *dirty* data, that writers should have a mutex that prevents both readers and writers.  Let's debug the book solution with PyCharm."
