    "### Remarks:\n",
    "\n",
    "This seems to work well enough and is a depth-first search.  It's interesting that you can create a class for coordinates so easily.  The search_maze_helper is a recursive method that first ensures that the coordinate is within the maze and that it is *ROAD* (legal move),  Next, it adds that to the *path* list and turns the coordinate *WALL* (illegal move) so that it doesn't create a circular path.  Then, it calls all four possible moves (up, down, left, and right) recursively on the updated map and if **any** of them are good it keeps going.  At some point one of the recursively called **search_maze_helper** may return **True**, meaning that **s** and **e** are the same thing and we have found a path.  Otherwise, there is no path.  Also you'll notice that since this is Depth-First search, that the path is not guaranteed to be optimal (shortest)."
