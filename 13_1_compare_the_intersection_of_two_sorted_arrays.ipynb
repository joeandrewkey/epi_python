    "### Remarks\n",
    "\n",
    "This took about 35 minutes to accomplish.  The most important part of developing this was learning more about the bisect library, which I used to do a binary search on both sorted arrays, to try ot exclude as much as possible from the remaining calculation.  Also, I had to test some edge cases, such as lists with no intersection at all or empty lists.  After processing the edge cases and reducing both arrays to only trimmed sub-arrays, we save a lot of time on the worst-case.  From the remaining trimmed sub-arrays, we run a counter over both to get the unique keys.  This should be an O(a + b) runtime for the loops, plus O(e) for the number of unique elements in array a.  This could be improved by ensuring that a is always the smaller of the two lists"
