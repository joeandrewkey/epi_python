    "## 17_05 Find the majority element\n",
    "\n",
    "You are reading a sequence of strings.  You know a priori that more than half the strings are repetitions of a single string (the \"majority element\") but the positions where the majority element occurs are unknown.  Write a program that makes a single pass over the sequence and identifies the majority element for example, if the input is (b, a, c, a, a, b, a, a, c, a), then a is the majority element (it appears in 6 out of the ten places).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hint\n",
    "Take advantage of the existence of the majority element to perform elimination.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Initial Remarks\n",
    "The chapter is Greedy Algorithms and invariants, so I think that I can try something greedy. If I know the length of the sequence, then I know what it takes to constitute a majority element.  If I read the sequence in order, I can tell whether or not a given string could possibly be the majority element.  For instance, at the sixth string of a sequence of ten, I am guaranteed to have seen the majority element at least once.  At the seventh element, I need to have seen the majority element at least twice.  If I keep count of the number of times that I see an element, I should be able to determine what to start eliminating at the n/2 mark, where n is the length of the sequence.\n",
