    "\n",
    "Without knowing the length of a linked list, it is not trivial to delete the kth last element in a singly linked list.  Given a singly linked list and an integer k, write a program to remove the kth last element from the list.  Your algorith cannot use more than a few words of storage, regardless of the length of the list.  In particular, you cannot assume that it is possible to record the length of the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Hint*: If you know the length of the list, can you find the kth last node using two iterators?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Remarks:\n",
    "I think I can just keep count of how many nodes into a list I am.  When I reach K, I can create a pointer to the head of the list, as I keep going, I can update K to K.next, once the list is traversed, the value at K is the Kth. last.  I can keep a trailing pointer L, that follows behind K and then assign L.next to K.next."
