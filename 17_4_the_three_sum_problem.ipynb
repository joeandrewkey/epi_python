    "Design an algorithm that takes as input an array and a number, and determines if there are three entries in the array (not necessarily distinct which add up to the specified number.  For example, if the array is (11, 2, 5, 7, 3) then there are three entries in the array which add up to 21 (3, 7, 11 and 5, 5, 11).   (Note that we can use 5 twice, since the problem statement said we can use the same entry more than once.  However there are no entries that add up to 22.\n",

First off, if the number is less than 3 times the smallest number in the array, then that won't work.  The same would work for numbers that are three times greater than the max of the array.  Let's try a first solution.\n",
